I got this recipe from my father who used to make these all the time.
I've made them for various events the last few years and people seem
to like them.

## Ingredients

    4 eggs - beaten \ whip together by
	1c oil          / drizzling in slowly
	2c sugar
	2c brown sugar
	5c oats (rolled or ground)
	4c flour
	2 tsp baking soda
	2 tsp baking powder
	1 1/2 tsp salt
	2 tsp vanilla
	2c chocolate chips
	3c nuts

## Directions

Add all the dry ingredients together in a mixer and stir them
together.  Whip the eggs, oil and vanilla together separately and then
add it slowly to the dry ingredients in the mixer as it runs.

Depending on how many cookies I need, I use either a 1/2 cup or 1/4
cup scoop for each cookie.  Bake on greased cookie sheets at 375F for
~10 minutes.  On our oven, I usually do around 12 minutes.
